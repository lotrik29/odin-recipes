# odin-recipes
recipe website project

Building a basic website showcasing a recipe.
This will show that I can create:
				A boiler plate with no reference.
				A title to show on the browser.
				headings.
				links to other pages within the site.
				adding pictures with an "alt" description.
				making lists ordered and unordered.
				writing things using the paragraph element.
				using the paragraph element to space out text.
